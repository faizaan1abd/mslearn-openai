## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure OpenAI**: Integrates your data with massive language models, allowing for personalized and secure interactions. Allows for fine-tuning of AI models with your own datasets, resulting in specialized and relevant outputs for your business needs.
- **Azure OpenAI Models**: Provides pre-trained and customisable big language models for a variety of AI applications, including text generation, sentiment analysis, and language translation, with the option to tailor models to specific use cases.
- **Azure CloudShell**: Offers an online, browser-based shell for managing Azure resources and running scripts. Allows you to deploy, manage, and automate Azure services directly from your web browser, eliminating the need for local installations.
- **DALL-E**: DALL-E uses artificial intelligence technology to generate visuals from written descriptions. Enhances creativity by translating word inputs into distinct and coherent pictures.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Prompt engineering fine-tunes input prompts to improve AI model replies, ensuring accurate and relevant outputs by optimizing how prompts are produced and delivered to AI models.
- **AI chat**: AI chat, also known as an AI chatbot or conversational AI, is a technology that uses artificial intelligence to facilitate automated, human-like conversations between machines and users. These systems are designed to understand and interpret natural language inputs, enabling them to respond in a way that simulates a real conversation.
