# Lab 02: Use Azure OpenAI SDKs in your app

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

In the lab, you will perform the role of a software developer who has been tasked to implement an app that can use generative AI to help provide hiking recommendations. The techniques used in the exercise can be applied to any app that utilizes Azure OpenAI APIs.

With the Azure OpenAI Service, developers can create chatbots, language models, and other applications that excel at understanding natural human language. The Azure OpenAI provides access to pre-trained AI models, as well as a suite of APIs and tools for customizing and fine-tuning these models to meet the specific requirements of your application. In this exercise, you'll learn how to deploy a model in Azure OpenAI and use it in your application.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
- Task 2: Set up an application in Cloud Shell
- Task 3: Configure your application
- Task 4: Test your application

## Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource

Before you can use Azure OpenAI models, you must provision an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **OpenAI (1)** and select **Azure OpenAI (2)**.

    - Resource group: Select **openai-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject> (2)**
    - Region: **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" /> (3)**
    - Storage account name: **storage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject> (4)**
    - File share: Create a new file share named **none** **(5)**
    - Click **Create** (6)

        ![](../media/nlpe18.png "Create storage advanced settings")

1. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the page, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the page to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview). 

1. Once the terminal opens, click on **Settings (1)** and select **Go to Classic Version (2)**.

1. Once the terminal starts, enter the below-mentioned command to download the sample application and save it to a folder called `azure-openai`.

    ```bash
   rm -r azure-openai -f
   git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-openai mslearn-openai
    ```

    ![](../media/L2T2S8-1507.png)    
  
1. The files are downloaded to a folder named **mslearn-openai**. Navigate to the lab files for this exercise using the following command.

    ```bash
   cd mslearn-openai/Labfiles/01-app-develop
    ```

    Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as a sample text file you'll use to test the summarization. Both apps feature the same functionality.

1. Open the built-in code editor, and observe the text file that you'll be summarizing with your model. Use the following command to open the lab files in the code editor.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

       > **Note**: You can get the Azure OpenAI endpoint and key values from the Azure OpenAI resource's **Key and Endpoint** section under **Resource Management**.

1. Navigate back to the Cloudshell and install the necessary packages for your preferred language:

    **C#** : 

    ```bash
    cd CSharp
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --version 2.1.0
    ```

    **Python** : 

    ```bash
    cd Python
    python -m venv labenv
   ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
    pip install python-dotenv openai==1.65.2 --user
    ```

1. Navigate to your preferred language folder, replace the comment **Add Azure OpenAI package** with code to add the Azure OpenAI SDK library:

    **C#**: Program.cs

    ```csharp
    // Add Azure OpenAI packages
    using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
    using OpenAI.Chat;
    ```

     ![](../media/L2T3S6-1507.png) 

    **Python**: application.py

    ```python
    # Add Azure OpenAI package
    from openai import AsyncAzureOpenAI
    ```

     ![](../media/L2T3S6-py.png)      

1.  In the application code for your language, find the comment **Configure the Azure OpenAI client**, and add code to configure the Azure OpenAI client:

    **C#**: Program.cs

    ```csharp
    // Configure the Azure OpenAI client
    AzureOpenAIClient azureClient = new (new Uri(oaiEndpoint), new ApiKeyCredential(oaiKey));
    ChatClient chatClient = azureClient.GetChatClient(oaiDeploymentName);
    ```

     ![](../media/L2T3S7-1507.png)  

    **Python**: application.py

    ```python
    # Configure the Azure OpenAI client
    client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(
       azure_endpoint = azure_oai_endpoint, 
       api_key=azure_oai_key,  
       api_version="2024-02-15-preview"
      )
    ```

     ![](../media/L2T3S7-py.png)   

      >**Note**: Make sure to indent the code by eliminating any extra white spaces after pasting it into the code editor.
    
1. In the function that calls the **Azure OpenAI model**, under the comment **Get response from Azure OpenAI**, add the code to format and send the request to the model.

    **C#**: Program.cs

    ```csharp
      // Get response from Azure OpenAI
      ChatCompletionOptions chatCompletionOptions = new ChatCompletionOptions()
      {
         Temperature = 0.7f,
         MaxOutputTokenCount = 800
      };
      
      ChatCompletion completion = chatClient.CompleteChat(
         [
             new SystemChatMessage(systemMessage),
             new UserChatMessage(userMessage)
         ],
         chatCompletionOptions
      );
      
      Console.WriteLine($"{completion.Role}: {completion.Content[0].Text}");
    ```

     ![](../media/L2T3S8-1507.png)      

    **Python**: application.py

    ```python
    # Get response from Azure OpenAI
      messages =[
         {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
         {"role": "user", "content": user_message},
      ]
      
      print("\nSending request to Azure OpenAI model...\n")
      
      # Call the Azure OpenAI model
      response = await client.chat.completions.create(
         model=model,
         messages=messages,
         temperature=0.7,
         max_tokens=800
      )
    ```

     ![](../media/L2T3S8-py.png)

1. To save the changes made to the file, right-click on the blank space in the file text editor and hit **Save**

   >**Note:** Make sure to indent the code by eliminating any extra white spaces after pasting it into the code editor.

## Task 4: Test your application

Now that your app has been set up, you can just run it to send your request to your model and observe the response. You'll notice the only difference between the different options is the content of the prompt; all other parameters (such as token count and temperature) remain the same for each request.

1. In the folder of your preferred language, open the **system.txt** file. For each of the interactions, you'll enter the **System message** in this file and save it. Each iteration will pause first for you to change the system message.

1. In the interactive terminal pane, ensure the folder context is the folder for your preferred language. Then, enter the following command to run the application.

    - **C#**: `dotnet run`
    
    - **Python**: `python application.py`

      > **Tip**: You can use the **Maximize panel size** (**^**) icon in the terminal toolbar to see more of the console text.

1. For the first iteration, enter the following prompts:

   **System message:**
   ```
   You are an AI assistant
   ```
   
   **User message:**
   ```
   Write an intro for a new wildlife Rescue 
   ```

1. Observe the output. The AI model will likely produce a good generic introduction to a wildlife rescue.

1. Next, enter the following prompts, which specify a format for the response:

   **System message:**
   ```
   You are an AI assistant helping to write emails
   ```

   **User message:**
   ```
   Write a promotional email for a new wildlife rescue, including the following:-Rescue name is Contoso - It specializes in elephants - Call for donations to be given at our website
   ```

1. Observe the output. This time, you'll likely see the format of an email with the specific animals included, as well as the call for donations.

1. Next, enter the following prompts that additionally specify the content:

   **System message:**
   ```
   You are an AI assistant helping to write emails
   ```

   **User message:**
   ```
   Write a promotional email for a new wildlife rescue, including the following: - Rescue name is Contoso - It specializes in elephants, as well as zebras and giraffes - Call for donations to be given at our website - Include a list of the current animals we have at our rescue after the signature, in the form of a table. These animals include elephants, zebras, gorillas, lizards, and jackrabbits.
   ```
1. Observe the output, and see how the email has changed based on your clear instructions.   

1. Next, enter the following prompts where we add details about tone to the system message:

   **System message:**
   ```
   You are an AI assistant that helps write promotional emails to generate interest in a new business. Your tone is light, chit-chat oriented, and you always include at least two jokes.
   ```

   **User message:**
   ```
   Write a promotional email for a new wildlife rescue, including the following: - Rescue name is Contoso - It specializes in elephants, as well as zebras and giraffes - Call for donations to be given at our website - Include a list of the current animals we have at our rescue after the signature, in the form of a table. These animals include elephants, zebras, gorillas, lizards, and jackrabbits..
   ```

1. Observe the output. This time, you'll likely see the email in a similar format, but with a much more informal tone. You'll likely even see jokes included!
