# Utilize prompt engineering in your app

### Overall Estimated Duration: 30 minutes

## Overview

This lab explores the Azure OpenAI Service, where you'll provision the service, deploy a model, apply prompt engineering, configure and run an application in Cloud Shell, and enhance user interactions.

## Objective

This lab provides hands-on experience with Azure OpenAI resources, covering tasks such as provisioning a resource, deploying a model, applying prompt engineering, setting up and configuring an application in Cloud Shell, and maintaining conversation history. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Utilize prompt engineering in your app:** This hands-on exercise demonstrates how to use prompt engineering methods to improve AI interactions in your application. Participants will use prompt engineering strategies to enhance the performance and relevance of AI.

## Pre-requisites

- **Development Skills:** Basic programming knowledge and experience with APIs and SDKs.

- **AI Concepts:** Understanding prompt engineering, code development, and image generation using models such as DALL-E.

- **Content Management:** Understanding data integration for RAG and content filtering techniques.

## Architecture

The architecture uses Azure OpenAI Service to provision resources, deploy models, and set up an application in Cloud Shell. It involves configuring, testing, and maintaining the application for efficient AI-driven solutions with Azure’s scalability and security.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure OpenAI Resource:** Provision an Azure OpenAI resource to access OpenAI’s advanced AI models and integrate them into custom applications.

- **Model Deployment:** Deploy an OpenAI model to enable functionality for testing and application use cases.

- **Application Setup:** Set up an application in Cloud Shell to interact with the deployed model and test its capabilities.

- **Application Configuration:** Configure the application to meet specific requirements, ensuring seamless integration with Azure OpenAI services.

- **Application Testing:** Test the application to validate its performance, ensuring it interacts effectively with the deployed model.

## Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the lab guide bottom area to switch to different exercises of the lab guide.
